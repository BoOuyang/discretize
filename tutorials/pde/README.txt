Solving PDEs
============


To solve a PDE numerically we must complete the following steps:

	1. Formulate the problem; e.g. the PDE and its boundary conditions
	2. Re-formulate the problem using the weak formulation
	3. Evaluate the inner products according to the finite volume method
	4. Formulate and solve the discretized system

This section is meant to show how *discretize* can be used to solve
a variety of PDEs.
